# One Page Site
 # First thing I've done is watch Burning on Amazon Prime as I'm a visual learner and that was the best way to get information in my head about the Black Summer
 # Apon that I have got ideas on the design before doing my full research
 # I want a map of Australia with fire fazing in and out as the main page
 # I want the site to be navigated as if it was a map and you are clicking on locations, however only a few specific locations are important, the rest will be placed as I see fit.
 # I've started by finding copyright free images to use as well as sounds for afire on the main page. I've gone throught and edited them accordly to how I want the site presented.

# The first thing I've done is get the background implimeted, I wanted the website to be around the size of the image I choose with the background not looping but just 1 solid thing.
# I was able to add the mp3 file to the site however I want to change it around, I can't add an autoplay due to chrome limitations, and I wasn't planning to have the controls visable but I think I will make it so the person visiting the site has to click a welcome button of some sort which can be a trigger for the audio to play. Might have the audio controls moved to the bottom right to still give the user the option to change the volume. But I want to remove the play pause and skip option, just have volume options. ~~ this will help https://css-tricks.com/lets-create-a-custom-audio-player/
# I was able to make the button disapear when pressed and have audio play when the button is pressed. I currently dont have any controls for the audio but I dont really want any after thinking about it.
# I made the background the same color as the images background but for some reason when the window isnt full screne it adds extra side scrolling. Will come back to this to fix.
# on that note while adding images to the site I realised I could fix my background issue  by changing its width to 100% rather than the 2000px it was on causing the background to always need to be said size. Keeping the height at 2000px allows aus map to always be in the window

Retrospective

Looking at it now, my eyes were too big for my stomach on this assessment.
What I envisioned wasn't acheiveable with the time I gave myself to do this assessment.
The idea what to have australia map always in the window of the browser, once you open it fire noises start and fire randomly appears over australia.
While in the forfront of the flames there were locations dotted around the map which you could click on and get information bubble appear from them. They would have a simple hover animation before the click.
The site idea was fairly strightforward, but in hindsight my abilities to acheive this in a timely manner wasn't there.
I started with the background, pretty easy, have the image get placed in the background and move on.
Just getting the image to line up the way I wanted was a nightmare, it even got changed when I was close to finishing because what I did to start was so inaficent.
Thankfully I have family in my life that are more adept with coding and were able to look at parts of what I've done and give me advice on what to change and how. Even providing me the resources of sites I wasn't fimilar with to do so.
My degree is in film production, as of writing this retrospective its slightly changed around, I was doing this class because I had to for my breath major in digital design, however I am no longer doing this breath major due to a change in my main degree.
I thought this class and these assessments would be easy, as I did programing in highschool (hated it but still did it) and I even ran my own business doing web design for clients. Primarly using sites like squarespace for the hosting and the code elememnts, with the ocasional client wanting something more complete that I would have to write the code injection for.
But this all gave me a false sence of ability when it came to tackeling this assessment, it is very clear to me that coding/programing is not my stong suit. However I did choose to reframe from doing most of my work in abode apps.
I researched the topic of the Aussie bushfires prior to starting the assessment, watching the Buning documentary on Amazon Prime to get a bunch of facts. I used that in reference to the website provided to get my core points into the site.
I'm more of a visual learner so the documentary helped as a refresher. I was personally on the central coast at the time of black summer and remember the fires being in all the srounding areas. This felt more approperate for me to talk about than any of the other topic ideas.
Now that my ADHD rambling set up is complete back to what did for the site, The background was 'ready' being centerd of the body of the site at all times, I had to find the color code of the background of the image so that when the size changed and the picture couldn't fit, the image was still in the same water colored background.
With that out of the way the next part was the music, in hindsight the music was relativly easy, link the mp3 track with the controls and happy days. Then I realised I couldn't autoplay the music. So I came up with the idea that there should be a warning button to the site which could also serve as the play button for the music and the fire
For the music this was no problem. Took many attempts to figure out how I wanted the placing to work but we got there.
I knew the fire was going to be complicated and if there was a part of the site I could give up on it would be that, so the image boxes were next.
This is when I realised I would never get the locations to be where I want on the map ever with the current background set up I had. And I spent a good 10 hours 1 day just starting at my screen, articles and guides to try figure it out. And I got nothing, I would come close then it wouldn't work. I might have been able to use a canvas like I did with the fire (when we get to that) But I decided that the placement was too difficult and gave up on it
The new location would be the side of the screen, locked in place like the start button was
Once I was able to figure out the structure of the menus coding(thank you w3bb, youtube and family) Adjusting the images and the hover effects was easy. (after missing a few " which wasted an hour)
This is where I mention the images were all pretty much put through photoshop before going to the site. I know i could have done a circle crop for the menu images but I was easier to get the effect I wanted with the images to just put them into photoshop.
Same with the audio, the 1 track that is in the final site is actually 3 tracks combined, I got 3 tracks off youtube, used adobe audition to line them up time wise chopping off the start and ends, adjusting 2 of the tracks so one is more in the left ear and one is more in the right giving the effect of being srounded by fire when placed in the site
I know I could have probably figure out a way to code this but that just seemed way too complicated, it took me 15 minutes to do it the way I did rather than waste probably 5+ hours to figure out a way to do in on vsc.
I has the same idea with the fire, I would just make a video in after effects, where the fire changes in and out and could be looped. But then I had the idea of, oh how about I figure out code so it to loop but it randomly selects 1 of 7 images and randomly places said image. This was a dumb idea. Not dumb as in it coudnt' be done
but dumb in the sence I had already constructed this whole site and to put that effect in would be a nightmare. Low and behold I have a verson of what I wanted. At the moment it generates the fire on a canvas, the canvas hides when the text bubbles pop up, and ads more fire each time it goes back.
There is a code fix so its the same amount of random fire each time but I like it piling up. So yes its a choice for it to do that, its like the inaction of our goverment not doing anything about the black summer fires. It just makes them get bigger and bigger.
But finishing up we have the text boxes that appear when you click their icon, figuring out the JS and CSS for this was such an effort for what should have been the simpliest part of the site. But we got there, then with a bunch of fiddling we end up with an image, heading and text information. 
And thats a completed site.. Now Im writing this after craming the last bit of work in last night, only for me to realise I hadn't done a retrospective yet, meaning I'm submitting this 2 days past due an possibly loosing 10 marks. I've requested an extension prior to the due date but it just lined up in such a way I might not get it.
I know it's not the best information I could have given for the website, I don't really even site my sources extept saying trust me its in the burning doc. But with the amount of stress this assessment has put me through, Im proud to be disapointed in the shit website I made that I can only hope gets a passing grade.
I'm never going out of my way to do coding again, I hate it to my core, But it gives me a whole lot of apreciation to people like my brother and cousin in law who are actually aweseome at this stuff (and without there help I would of def dropped out of this unit a day before the last assessment was due) 
This isn't for me, Im a simple guy who likes his cameras and editing software, but I enjoy understarting slight bits of code when they are shown to me by people I consider much smarted than me. 
ps I know this retrospective probably sucks majorly and I'm sorry for that, my fiancee normally proof reads my essays because I'm ADHD, dyslexic and have a bad habbit of saying it how it is (to me) but she's not here before I have to get this submitted and If i have to spend any longer than what i'm guessing was 100 hours crammed into 2 weeks on this assessment I'm gonna lose my mind
So thanks for reading my ramblings
